Various resources helpful / necessary for BU's CS411 Software Engineering course

### When you identified the risk.
I identified the risk a couple days after my follow up email with my partner. I first emailed my partner on March 20th. Then I waited for them at the labs hoping that they just missed my email. On March 22nd, I reached out to someone who I assumed was my partner on social media. Finally, I gave them a follow up email on March 24th. After a couple business days, I decided to reach out to the professor. 


### When/how you communicated it to Peter.
I communicated this situation through email with Professor Peter on Friday March 28th after the lab session that morning. 


### What the mitigation or pivot plan was.
The mitigation or pivot plan was to reach out to fellow members in the lecture to understand how they were working on the project. I reached out to both Erin and Jocelyn and was able to get a better understanding on what was expected of the project and how to approach it. Then my next steps were to go to office hours when needed. 

### What the final outcome was.
The final outcome was a working project with all the smoke tests working and everything passing. 

### When you wrapped up the work.
I wrapped up the work on Wednesday April 2nd around 11PM. I then emailed Professor Peter following finishing the assignment.
